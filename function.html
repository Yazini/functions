          <h1>Function</h1>
          <p>a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are fundamental building blocks in programming that help to organize and modularize code,
             making it easier to read, maintain, and debug. </p>

            <section id="Define what is a function call">
              <h1>Function call</h1>
              <p> function calling is when you ask a program to run a specific block of code that you’ve defined elsewhere.
                 It’s like giving a command to execute a particular task, and it helps make your code organized, reusable, and easier to understand.</p>

<section id="Define function definition">
<h1>Function defintion</h1>
<p> -Modularity of Code: Functions help break down a program into smaller, manageable modules. Each function can be developed, tested, and debugged.
      independently, making the overall program more organized and easier to understand.
    -Abstraction: Functions allow programmers to abstract the details of a particular operation. Instead of dealing with the entire implementation, a programmer can use a function with a clear interface, relying on its functionality without needing to understand the internal complexities.
    -Code Reusability: Functions enable the reuse of code by encapsulating specific functionality. Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times from different parts of the program, reducing redundancy and promoting efficient code maintenance.</p>

<section id="What is a variable">
  <h1>Variable</h1>
  <p>A variable, in the context of programming, is a symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used independent of the information it represents. Variables are associated with data storage locations, and values of a variable are normally changed during the course of program execution. Variables represent all kinds of data, including 
    booleans, names, integers, arrays, pictures, sounds, scalars, strings,
     or any object or class of objects depending on the programming language that supports them. The symbolic names of variables are replaced with the actual data location by compilers and interpreters. 
    Data in locations changes during execution while locations and names are fixed. </p>
